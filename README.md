## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The build process from mobile first to web at 1440px wide. In between, I added some media queries to smooth the views between the two.

I have also learned how to position elements using CSS Grid.

I've added normalize.css to try to make it look the same in all browsers.


### Continued development

Perhaps for the next time, it would be nice to use some tool that allows me to better see the CSS of the elements. Chrome's developer tools don't help that much. I think in Firefox it's a bit better.

### Useful resources

- [Normalize CSS](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - This helps normalize viewing across all browsers.
- [CodingTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodingTube) - This is an amazing Youtube channel with hundreds of videos that explain CSS very well. Thanks, David!
